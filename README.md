Scrapy spider which gets prices form a web catalouge and saves them to an Excel file.

From each part web page, the spider takes a list price, our price which is price with discount and a part number. Everything goes into a spreadsheet, always to the same row as the part number. Additional part number is used only to check if the spider got into a proper page.  For every wrong part number, spiders returns an error message and passes empty cells.
